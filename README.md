# New Dawn
A framework for presenting a Web interface as a Classic Mac window. The name is a play on After Dark, as [`after-dark-css`](https://github.com/bryanbraun/after-dark-css) inspired this extension and provided the basic System 7.1.1 window layout. We will also support the more sophisticated Mac OS 8.1 window layout.
